# Function 1: Input data and format check (is the data in the format that the software requires?)

# Is the first column that sample names?
# Is the first column name "studyid"
# Are the columns values (other than the first column) the wavenumber value (as a 2 decimal place float)
# Are there any non-values?
# Are all values (other than the first column) floats (or able to be converted into floats)


# Function 2: Data seperation
# Needs to separate the dataset into wavenumber, sample name, class labels, and spectral dataset


# Function 3: Preprocessing
# Baseline correction, scaling, etc. for the data matrix

# recombine the dataset as required
